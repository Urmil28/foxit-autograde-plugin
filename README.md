# Foxit Autograde Plugin
Quickly autograde answersheets submitted by students against a answer key generated by the user.

The following functionality is completed:<br />
•	  User can convert any pdf into a autograding document by adding the form fields to a particular document<br />
•	  User can write a sample answer and generate a sample answer key used to autograde the answersheets.<br />
•	  User can have the ideal answer as either a number (Integer value) or an option number (eg. a,b,c ) or a one word answer.<br />
•	  The plugin will point out the wrong answers of a student and show the correct answer next to each question where the form field is present, and will also print out the total number of marks achieved by the student.<br /><br />

# Installations
This plugin does not require any 3rd party library.

# Requirements
Only one answerkey may currently exist at a time. If you are auto grading multiple papers simultaneously, the user will have to generate the answer keys everytime.
Hence it is recommended to finish off all answersheets of one question paper before started a different paper.

# Technologies Used
Foxit PhantomPDF Plugin SDK, Microsoft C++ REST SDK
